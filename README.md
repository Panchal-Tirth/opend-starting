While building and learning it simultaneously 🚀, I learned about Motoko, how web applications are built on blockchain ⛓️🔗, and how the Web3 ecosystem works 🌐. But I'm still not that proficient in Web3 . For now, I learned it as part of Angela Yu's course on Udemy 🎓. However, I am currently focused on learning AI/ML 🤖, building projects for my portfolio 🏗️, and trying to get my hands on open-source contributions 💻.

So, I'll come back to learning Web3 later in the future 😊. Until then, here's how you can run it and enjoy it on your local PC 💻!

# NFT MarketPlace on ICP Blockchain

## Project Overview

This project is a decentralized NFT marketplace built on the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain using Dfinity's `dfx`. It is inspired by OpenSea and allows users to buy, sell, and discover NFTs. The platform also introduces a custom cryptocurrency that can be used to trade NFTs within the ecosystem.

The project is part of my learning journey in web development from Angela Yu's Udemy course. It is currently for local testing and has not been deployed yet.

## Features

- **NFT Discovery** – Browse and discover NFTs available for sale or trade.
- **Buy and Sell NFTs** – List your NFTs for sale or purchase NFTs from other users.
- **Custom Cryptocurrency Integration** – Exchange NFTs using a proprietary cryptocurrency created as a separate project.
- **Decentralized Infrastructure** – Built on the ICP blockchain for a secure and distributed environment.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **Backend:** Dfinity (dfx) for blockchain and smart contract deployment
- **Blockchain:** Internet Computer (ICP)
- **Cryptocurrency:** Custom crypto token (Independent Project)

## Installation and Setup
